# ======================== GIT SSH CHEAT SHEET ======================== #
# This assumes you're using SSH (git@github.com:username/repo.git)
# and that your SSH key is already configured in ~/.ssh/

# --- Core workflow --- #
git status                                   # check repo status (shows modified/untracked files)
git add orbiting_spot_data/                  # stage all CSVs in orbiting_spot_data folder
git add .                                    # OR stage everything in the repo
git commit -m "Organized orbiting_spot_data files"   # commit staged changes with message
git pull --rebase origin main                # pull latest changes before pushing
git push origin main                         # push committed changes to GitHub main branch

# --- Useful utilities --- #
git log --oneline                            # view short commit history
git diff                                     # see unstaged changes in detail
git remote -v                                # confirm SSH remote URL (should start with git@)
ssh -T git@github.com                        # test SSH connection to GitHub (expect greeting)
git branch                                   # show current branch and available branches
git checkout branchname                      # switch to another branch
git merge branchname                         # merge another branch into current one
git add . && git commit -m "quick update" && git push origin main   # one-line update and push

# ========================== EXAMPLE WORKFLOW ========================== #

# Example: You organized your CSVs in orbiting_spot_data and want to push updates
cd ~/github/myrepo                           # go to your repo
git status                                   # check which CSVs changed
git add orbiting_spot_data/                  # stage the updated CSV files
git commit -m "Cleaned up orbiting_spot_data folder and added new datasets"
git pull --rebase origin main                # make sure your branch is up to date
git push origin main                         # push your changes to GitHub

# Example: You want to get new changes someone else pushed
git pull origin main                         # pulls the latest commits from GitHub

# Example: You edited remotely or on another machine and need to merge
git fetch origin main                        # fetches changes without merging
git merge origin/main                        # merges fetched updates into your local branch

# Example: Creating a quick update in one line
git add . && git commit -m "updated CSVs" && git push origin main
